# openclaw-memory-decay

**Give your OpenClaw a memory — one that forgets.**

An OpenClaw plugin that replaces flat file-based memory with a human-like decay system. Important things stick. Noise fades. Your agent remembers what matters without drowning in everything else.

Built on [memory-decay-core](https://github.com/memory-decay/memory-decay-core) — a mathematical memory model where activation decays over time, stability grows through recall, and retrieval consolidation reinforces what you actually use.

## Why

AI agents forget everything between sessions. The usual fix: dump everything into files and load it all back.

That works. Until it doesn't.

- 50 lines of memory → great. 500 lines → context pollution. 5000 lines → the agent stops attending to what matters.
- Everything is stored equally. A one-off joke about coffee has the same weight as your API architecture decisions.
- Retrieval is binary: either it's in the file or it isn't. No notion of "I think I remember this, but I'm not sure."

`openclaw-memory-decay` solves this with **decay**:

- Memories have an activation score that decreases over time — like human forgetting
- Important memories decay slower; trivial ones fade fast
- When your agent recalls a memory, it gets reinforced — the testing effect
- Search results come with freshness indicators: `fresh`, `normal`, `stale`
- The result: your agent naturally retains what matters and loses what doesn't

```

      │ ●●                                     ● (reinforced — recalled)

      │
  0.0 └─────────────────────────────────────────── Time
        ● saved at importance 0.9    ▴ saved at importance 0.3
```

## Features

- **Decay-aware search** — retrieval scores blend semantic similarity with activation and reinforcement history
- **Automatic noise cleanup** — low-importance memories decay naturally; no manual pruning
- **Retrieval consolidation** — memories get stronger every time they're recalled, modeling the testing effect
- **Category-aware storing** — the agent picks the right category (`preference`, `decision`, `fact`, `episode`) with calibrated importance (0.3–1.0), not a flat 0.8 for everything
- **Proactive agent saves** — the agent stores preferences, decisions, facts, and episodes without being asked
- **Freshness indicators** — search results include `fresh` / `normal` / `stale` so the agent can judge reliability
- **Dual-score model** — storage score (can it be found?) and retrieval score (how easily?) are tracked separately
- **Memory tools** — the plugin exposes `memory_search`, `memory_store`, and `memory_store_batch`
- **Markdown migration** — imports existing `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/` files on first run

## Quick Start

> Deprecated: installing from a cloned checkout via `openclaw plugins install -l .` is no longer the recommended path. Use the published npm package instead.

```bash
# 1. Install the backend into a dedicated virtualenv
python3 -m venv ~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay
~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay/bin/pip install memory-decay

# 2. Install this plugin from npm
openclaw plugins install openclaw-memory-decay

# 3. (Optional but recommended) Restrict auto-load to trusted plugins only
openclaw config set plugins.allow '["openclaw-memory-decay"]'

# 4. Restart the gateway
openclaw gateway restart
```

> **Note:** If the plugin is already loaded, install may succeed silently. Use `openclaw plugins list` to confirm status is `loaded`.

### Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) installed globally
- Python 3.10+
- A Python virtualenv containing `memory-decay`

## Migration From Deprecated Local Install

If you previously installed this plugin from a local checkout via `openclaw plugins install -l .`, migrate to the npm package. Local/path-based installs are now deprecated in favor of the published npm package.

```bash
# 1. Remove the old pre-0.1.8 plugin install if it exists
openclaw plugins uninstall memory-decay

# 2. Install from npm instead
openclaw plugins install openclaw-memory-decay

# 3. Restart gateway
openclaw gateway restart

# 4. Verify
openclaw plugins list | grep openclaw-memory-decay  # should show: openclaw-memory-decay | loaded
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/health       # should show: {"status":"ok","current_tick":0}
```

If the old install is already gone, `openclaw plugins uninstall memory-decay` will simply report that nothing was removed.

If auto-detection does not recover your backend path after migration, set the interpreter explicitly:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-memory-decay.config.pythonPath "~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay/bin/python"
openclaw gateway restart
```

If you are upgrading from an older release, note the plugin id changed from `memory-decay` to `openclaw-memory-decay` in `0.1.8`.

- New installs should use `plugins.entries.openclaw-memory-decay`.
- Older configs under `plugins.entries.memory-decay.config` are still read as a compatibility fallback.
- For a clean config, migrate to the new key when convenient.

**Your memories are safe.** The SQLite database (`memories.db`) is not affected by plugin reinstallation or migration to npm install.

To update in the future:
```bash
openclaw plugins update openclaw-memory-decay
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Configuration

Add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `plugins.entries.openclaw-memory-decay.config`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-memory-decay": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "dbPath": "~/.openclaw/memory-decay-data/memories.db",
          "serverPort": 8100,
          "autoSave": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `serverPort` | `8100` | Port for the memory-decay HTTP server |
| `memoryDecayPath` | (auto) | Path to memory-decay-core. Auto-detected at runtime from the documented default venv or from explicit config |
| `pythonPath` | `python3` | Path to Python interpreter. Set this explicitly if you do not use `~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay` |
| `dbPath` | `~/.openclaw/memory-decay-data/memories.db` | SQLite database location |
| `autoSave` | `true` | Auto-save every conversation turn at low importance. Set `false` to let the agent decide what to save |
| `embeddingProvider` | `local` | Embedding provider: `local`, `openai`, or `gemini` |
| `embeddingApiKey` | (auto) | API key for embedding provider. Falls back to env vars (see below) |
| `embeddingModel` | (auto) | Specific embedding model name |
| `embeddingDim` | (auto) | Embedding dimension (auto-detected from provider) |

### API Key Configuration

The API key for embedding providers is resolved in this order:

1. **Plugin config** — `embeddingApiKey` in `openclaw.json`
2. **Generic env var** — `MD_EMBEDDING_API_KEY`
3. **Provider-specific env var** — `OPENAI_API_KEY` (openai) or `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (gemini)

```bash
# Example: use OpenAI embeddings with API key from environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Or use the generic variable (works with any provider)
export MD_EMBEDDING_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

When using the `local` provider (default), no API key is needed — embeddings are computed locally using sentence-transformers.

### autoSave: true vs false

| Mode | Who stores | When | Importance |
|------|-----------|------|------------|
| `autoSave: true` | Plugin automatically | Every conversation turn | 0.3 (low) |
| `autoSave: false` | Agent decides | When something is worth remembering | 0.8 (high, set by agent) |

With `autoSave: false`, the agent uses `memory_store` proactively — storing facts, decisions, preferences, and important context. Noise stays out of the memory system entirely.

## Memory Categories

The bootstrap prompt and skills guide the agent to pick the right category and importance:

| Category | When | Importance | Example |
|----------|------|------------|---------|
| `preference` | User's role, style, habits, likes/dislikes | 0.8–1.0 | "User prefers Korean for conversation, English for code" |
| `decision` | Why X was chosen, tradeoffs, rejected alternatives | 0.8–0.9 | "Chose SQLite over Postgres — single-node, no ops overhead" |
| `fact` | Technical facts, API behaviors, architecture | 0.7–0.9 | "Auth service returns inconsistent 4xx on token expiry" |
| `episode` | What was worked on, session context | 0.3–0.6 | "Finished migrating auth middleware" |

The agent stores proactively based on conversation triggers — it doesn't wait to be explicitly asked.

                               │                              │
```

The plugin manages the Python server lifecycle — starts with the gateway, stops on shutdown.

### Memory Lifecycle

```
  Store ──► Activate ──► Decay ──► Search ──► Reinforce ──► Decay (slower)
    │                        │                         │
    │                        │                         └──► Stability increases
    │                        │
    │                        └──► Low importance fades fast
    │                             High importance fades slow
    │
    └──► Importance set by agent (0.8) or auto-save (0.3)
```

1. **Store** — memory enters with an activation of 1.0 and a set importance
2. **Decay** — each tick, activation decreases based on importance and stability
3. **Search** — semantic similarity × activation weighting × BM25 re-ranking
4. **Reinforce** — recalled memories get boosted (testing effect), stability grows
5. **Forget** — memories with very low activation become practically unretrievable

## Tools

The plugin registers these tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory_search` | Search memories with decay-aware ranking and freshness indicators |
| `memory_store` | Save a single memory with calibrated importance and category |
| `memory_store_batch` | Save multiple memories efficiently in one call |

## Troubleshooting

### `plugins.allow is empty; discovered non-bundled plugins may auto-load`

This warning appears when `plugins.allow` is not set. While the plugin still loads (since it is explicitly configured in `plugins.entries`), it is good practice to restrict auto-load to trusted plugins only:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.allow '["openclaw-memory-decay"]'
openclaw gateway restart
```

### `Cannot find module 'openclaw/plugin-sdk'`

```bash
openclaw plugins install openclaw-memory-decay
```

### `Memory service not running`

```bash
# Check if the configured Python can import the server
~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay/bin/python -c "import memory_decay.server; print('ok')"

# Check server health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8100/health
```

If the import check fails, install the backend into the documented default venv path or set `pythonPath` explicitly:
```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay
~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay/bin/pip install memory-decay
```

If `memory-decay` is only installed in your system Python or in some other venv, the plugin may still fail to auto-detect it. In that case, point the plugin at the exact Python you want it to use:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-memory-decay.config.pythonPath "/absolute/path/to/python"
openclaw gateway restart
```

Sanity check the exact interpreter before restarting:

```bash
/absolute/path/to/python -c "import memory_decay.server; print('ok')"
```

If you use a different venv path, configure it directly:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-memory-decay.config.pythonPath "/absolute/path/to/venv/bin/python"
openclaw gateway restart
```

### `error: externally-managed-environment`

Your system Python is PEP 668 managed. Install `memory-decay` into a virtualenv instead of the system interpreter:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay
~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay/bin/pip install memory-decay
```

### Plugin shows `error` status

```bash
openclaw plugins doctor
```

## For AI Agents: Self-Installation Guide

> This section is written for LLM agents to follow autonomously. If you're a human, use the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section above.
> Use the published npm package. Do not install this plugin from a cloned checkout unless you are actively developing it.

### Quick Install (one-shot)

```bash
# 1. Install the backend into a dedicated virtualenv
python3 -m venv ~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay
~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay/bin/pip install memory-decay

# 2. Install plugin from npm
openclaw plugins install openclaw-memory-decay

# 3. Restart gateway
openclaw gateway restart

# 4. Verify plugin is loaded
openclaw plugins list
# Look for: openclaw-memory-decay | loaded

# 5. Check server health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","current_tick":0}
```

### Diagnosing Issues

**Plugin shows `error` status:**
```bash
openclaw plugins doctor
# Check the error message for missing dependencies or path issues
```

**`Cannot find module 'openclaw/plugin-sdk'`:**
```bash
openclaw plugins install openclaw-memory-decay
```

**`Memory service not running`:**
```bash
# Check the configured Python can import the backend server
~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay/bin/python -c "import memory_decay.server; print('ok')"

# Check if gateway started it
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/health

# If the import fails, reinstall into the venv:
~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay/bin/pip install memory-decay
openclaw gateway restart
```

**Port conflict (8100 in use):**
```json
// In ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json, change:
"serverPort": 8101
```

**Embedding errors:**
```bash
# Switch to OpenAI if local embeddings fail
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
export MD_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Key Files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` | Plugin configuration |
| `~/.openclaw/memory-decay-data/memories.db` | Memory database |
| `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/` | Legacy memory files (can migrate) |

## Known Upgrade Issues

These are real migration issues we hit while moving from older releases. If an AI agent is helping with setup, it should check these before assuming the install itself is broken.

### 1. Old `memory-decay` install still exists

Symptom:
- `duplicate plugin id detected`
- `plugin id mismatch`
- both `memory-decay` and `openclaw-memory-decay` appear in `openclaw plugins list`

Fix:

```bash
openclaw plugins uninstall memory-decay
openclaw gateway restart
```

If duplicate warnings still mention `.openclaw-install-stage-*`, remove stale failed-install directories:

```bash
find ~/.openclaw/extensions -maxdepth 1 -type d -name '.openclaw-install-stage-*' -print
find ~/.openclaw/extensions -maxdepth 1 -type d -name '.openclaw-install-stage-*' -exec rm -rf {} +
openclaw gateway restart
```

### 2. Plugin updated, but port `8100` never comes up

Symptom:
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:8100/health` times out
- gateway log says `Could not auto-detect memory-decay installation`

Fix:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-memory-decay.config.pythonPath "~/.openclaw/venvs/memory-decay/bin/python"
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-memory-decay.config.serverPort 8100
openclaw gateway restart
```

If you also need to restore the backend root explicitly:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-memory-decay.config.memoryDecayPath "/absolute/path/to/memory-decay-core"
openclaw gateway restart
```

### 3. `memory-decay` is installed, but only in system Python or another venv

Symptom:
- `pip show memory-decay` looks fine
- plugin still cannot find `memory_decay.server`

Fix:

```bash
/absolute/path/to/python -c "import memory_decay.server; print('ok')"
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-memory-decay.config.pythonPath "/absolute/path/to/python"
openclaw gateway restart
```
